limingzxc has updated this mod to use the CE 2.x.x fabric mod system. 
you can find that version here
https://github.com/limingzxc/DynamicLight/releases/tag/v1.1.0

# Hiracho's Dynamic Lighting [CE1.4.0]
A small mod for BTW that enables light sources to emit light when held in your active slot

Currently only emit light when holding a lit torch or crude torch :) 

## Compatabilities
- This addon isn't compatible with Fatty foods, I plan on making it compatible when CE1.3 hits
- everything else should work!
